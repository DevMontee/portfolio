# Flutter Analysis - P-Method and PK-Method

MATLAB implementation of flutter analysis for aircraft structures using P-Method and PK-Method.

## Files

- `pmethod.m` - P-Method flutter analysis implementation
- `PK.m` - PK-Method flutter analysis implementation

## Description

These scripts implement two classical flutter analysis methods used in aerospace engineering:
- **P-Method**: Frequency domain analysis for flutter prediction
- **PK-Method**: Advanced flutter analysis using matched poles approach

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- Control System Toolbox

## Usage

```matlab
% Run P-Method analysis
pmethod

% Run PK-Method analysis
PK
```

## Results

- Flight envelope analysis
- Flutter speed predictions  
- Validation against published results
- Comparison of both methods

See the [Flutter Analysis project page](../../flutter-analysis.html) for detailed visualizations and results.

## Background

Part of aeroelasticity coursework demonstrating structural dynamics and stability analysis capabilities for aircraft design.
